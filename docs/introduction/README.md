## Introduction

(From https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent 
developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency 
across all the platforms you care about â€” learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple 
production apps and will continue investing in React Native.

This book guides you through the basic setup required to get started with React Native (this might be a duplication
of the React Native docs but having all the required information offline helps).
