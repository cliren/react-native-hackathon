## Android

Android setup is takes a little longer than iOS and you will need to have following:
 
* Latest Java SDK. Download from [Download Java SDK ](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)  
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)

After installing the above two, follow the instructions to [Setup React Native for Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html)
